# bike-philadelphia-backend
A web app designed to practice building a backend in Django.


Corresponding frontend can be found at: https://github.com/egfrank/bike-philadelphia-frontend

Takes inspiration from PunkAve's [backend](https://github.com/punkave/backend-challenge)  challenge, although is implemented with Django and the Django Rest Framework instead of Node and Express.
